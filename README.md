If you don't want to compile NameGenerator yourself, you can download an executable [here](https://github.com/pommicket/NameGenerator/releases).

If you want to use NameGenerator in another program, `src/namegenerator/namegenerator.h` has some functions you can use. 

If you are compiling NameGenerator, you can use the `build.sh` shell script or `build_win.sh` for compiling for Windows on GNU/Linux.
